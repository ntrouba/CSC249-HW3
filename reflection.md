Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment and answer the prompts.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Test your `ping` and `traceroute` programs on 4 target hosts, each on a different continent and include the output below.

 For this assignment I worked with Lily Garner. What worked was majority of the code, I was able to fetch the RTT of the different sites. This assignment was more than I expected it to be initially as the harder part for me was running the terminal as opposed to writing the code. So my advice to future students in this course is to start assignments early. We could not get the terminal to print the ICMP header. The ICMP pinger worked mostly as expected but the ICMP trace route gave me quite a few issues. Getting it to run properly through the terminal just was not working. It said there was an error in checksum but it got me stuck since we were not supposed to modify that. We are both confident that the code is solid but there's work that needs to be done. I plan on attending office hours this week to hopefully clear up some of my confusion on this assignment and get on track for project 1.
